**CENG212, Fall 2015, Lab 7**

Using Eclipse project format.

Thomas, I've added the files from my previous labs that will be needed for lab
7. Feel free to replace them if you want.

**Style Guide**
Currently, I use tabs for indentation and keep my lines less than 80 characters
long. This is mainly because I program in VIM, in the terminal, and usually have
more than one code window open.

We should either use a similar coding style or never work on the same classes.
I think I'd rather we use the same coding style.
